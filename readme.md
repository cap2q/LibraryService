# Setting up the solution:

Oracle DDL's and DML are located in DDLandDML folders located within the project. Run the SQL files in the following order:

1. Lib_DDL.sql
2. MOCKDATA.sql

It is also necessary to configure the connection string within appsettings.json.

Once the connection string is updated, the solution should be good to go!
